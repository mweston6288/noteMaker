## Purpose

Write, save, and manage notes stored on a server.

## How to use

From the home page, click Get Started.

Write a title in the field that says Note Title by default and write the body in the 
field that says Note Text.

You can reset the text field by clicking on the pencil icon in the top right corner.

When the fields are filled in, a save icon will appear in the top right. Click on it to 
save the note.

All saved notes will appear on the left side of the page. Clicking on one will cause its 
content to appear on the right. You will have to click on the pencil icon to close the 
note.

If you click on the trash icon next to a saved note, it will be deleted.

## How to deploy

Open your Terminal and go to the directory that server.js is stored.

Run the command "npm install" to download all required npm modules. Then run "node server.js"

You can access the server by going on your web browser and going to localhost:8080.
Note: 8080 is the default port. Depending on what launch tool you use, the port number 
may be different.

## Future options
